# Line Drawing Test Report

## Current Implementation Status

Based on the code review, the line drawing functionality has been implemented with the following features:

### 1. Drawing Mode Toggle
- The Toolbar component includes a "Draw Line" button (PenTool icon) that toggles between 'select' and 'draw-line' modes
- Located at: src/components/Toolbar.tsx:481-491

### 2. Free-form Connections
- When in 'draw-line' mode, CustomNode renders transparent handles that cover the entire node
- This allows connections from anywhere on the node, not just fixed black dots
- Located at: src/components/CustomNode.tsx:65-107

### 3. Edge Anchor Points
- The edgeUtils module calculates proper anchor points where lines meet node edges
- Supports different node shapes (rectangle, circle, rhombus, etc.)
- Located at: src/utils/edgeUtils.ts

### 4. Custom Edge Rendering
- FlowchartEdge component uses edge anchor points in draw-line mode
- Lines start from node edges instead of centers
- Located at: src/components/edges/FlowchartEdge.tsx:26-38

### 5. Connection Line Preview
- CustomConnectionLine shows preview while dragging connections
- Also uses edge anchor calculations for proper positioning
- Located at: src/components/CustomConnectionLine.tsx

## Implementation Details

### Edge Anchor Calculation
The `getEdgeAnchorPoint` function calculates where a line from the node center to a target point intersects the node boundary. It handles:
- Rectangles: Calculates intersection with four edges
- Circles: Uses radius-based calculation
- Rhombus: Handles diamond shape with angle-based edge detection

### Handle Configuration
In draw-line mode, nodes render invisible handles that:
- Cover the entire node area
- Have transparent background
- Are positioned at z-index 10 for proper interaction

## Expected Behavior
1. Click the Draw Line button in the toolbar to enter draw-line mode
2. Drag from any point on a source node
3. Connection line preview shows from the node edge
4. Drop on any point on a target node
5. Final edge renders from edge to edge

The implementation appears complete and should address all the requirements from the user feedback.
